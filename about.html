        <h2>About Musically Inclined Music Lessons</h2>
        <!-- <img src="/images/piano_hands.jpg" alt="Student's hands playing piano."> -->
        <p>
          Musically Inlined Music Lessons is an in-home music lesson serving
          Garnet Valley and the surrounding areas. With lessons tailored to each
          student's needs and ability, MIML’s goal is to provide a fun, enjoyable,
          and meaningful musical experience in your home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Musically Inclined Music Lessons is designed to teach our students to
          not only learn music but to also enjoy it. At MIML, students will learn
          basic music skills such as reading, counting, note identification and
          recognition. Our goal is to get our students playing as soon as possible
          in preparation for our recitals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recitals are a chance for our students to show what they've learned.
          Performing in front of people can help students' confidence which often
          translates to other areas of their lives. Recitals also give parents an
          opportunity to see their child perform and see the progress their child
          has made since first taking music lessons.
