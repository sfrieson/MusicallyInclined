      <h2>About Musically Inclined Music Lessons</h2>
      <!-- <img src="/images/piano_hands.jpg" alt="Student's hands playing piano."> -->
      <p>
        Musically Inlined Music Lessons is an in-home music lesson serving
        Garnet Valley and the surrounding areas. With lessons tailored to each
        student's needs and ability, MIML’s goal is to provide a fun, enjoyable,
        and meaningful musical experience in your home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Musically Inclined Music Lessons is designed to teach our students to
        not only learn music but to also enjoy it. At MIML, students will learn
        basic music skills such as reading, counting, note identification and
        recognition. Our goal is to get our students playing as soon as possible
        in preparation for our recitals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recitals are a chance for our students to show what they've learned.
        Performing in front of people can help students' confidence which often
        translates to other areas of their lives. Recitals also give parents an
        opportunity to see their child perform and see the progress their child
        has made since first taking music lessons.
